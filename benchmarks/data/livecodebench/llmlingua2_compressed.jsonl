An infected child at position i can spread the disease to either of its immediate neighboring children at positions i - 1 and i + 1 if they exist and are currently not infected. At most one child who was previously not infected can get infected with the disease in one second.\nIt can be shown that after a finite number of seconds, all the children in the queue will get infected with the disease.
