{"id": "lcb_00000", "question": "Takahashi is hosting a contest with N players numbered 1 to N. \nThe players will compete for points. Currently, all players have zero points.\nTakahashi's foreseeing ability lets him know how the players' scores will change. Specifically, for i=1,2,\\dots,T, the score of player A_i will increase by B_i points at i seconds from now. There will be no other change in the scores.\nTakahashi, who prefers diversity in scores, wants to know how many different score values will appear among the players' scores at each moment. For each i=1,2,\\dots,T, find the number of different score values among the players' scores at i+0.5 seconds from now.\nFor example, if the players have 10, 20, 30, and 20 points at some moment, there are three different score values among the players' scores at that moment.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN T\nA_1 B_1\nA_2 B_2\n\\vdots\nA_T B_T\n\nOutput\n\nPrint T lines.\nThe i-th line (1\\leq i \\leq T) should contain an integer representing the number of different score values among the players' scores at i+0.5 seconds from now.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 1\\leq N, T\\leq 2\\times 10^5\n- 1\\leq A_i \\leq N\n- 1\\leq B_i \\leq 10^9\n- All input values are integers.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 4\n1 10\n3 20\n2 10\n2 10\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n3\n2\n2\n\nLet S be the sequence of scores of players 1, 2, 3 in this order.\nCurrently, S=\\lbrace 0,0,0\\rbrace.\n\n- After one second, the score of player 1 increases by 10 points, making S=\\lbrace 10,0,0\\rbrace.

In one operation, you can pick a character x from the string and change it to the character y at a cost of z if there exists any index j such that cost[j] == z, original[j] == x, and changed[j] == y.\nReturn the minimum cost to convert the string source to the string target using any number of operations. If it is impossible to convert source to target, return -1.\nNote that there may exist indices i, j such that original[j] == original[i] and changed[j] == changed[i].\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: source = \"abcd\", target = \"acbe\", original = [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"c\",\"e\",\"d\"], changed = [\"b\",\"c\",\"b\",\"e\",\"b\",\"e\"], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20]\nOutput: 28\nExplanation: To convert the string \"abcd\" to string \"acbe\":\n- Change value at index 1 from 'b' to 'c' at a cost of 5.\n- Change value at index 2 from 'c' to 'e' at a cost of 1.\n- Change value at index 2 from 'e' to 'b' at a cost of 2.\n- Change value at index 3 from 'd' to 'e' at a cost of 20.\nThe total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28.\nIt can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: source = \"aaaa\", target = \"bbbb\", original = [\"a\",\"c\"], changed = [\"c\",\"b\"], cost = [1,2]\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: To change the character 'a' to 'b' change the character 'a' to 'c' at a cost of 1, followed by changing the character 'c' to 'b' at a cost of 2, for a total cost of 1 + 2 = 3. To change all occurrences of 'a' to 'b', a total cost of 3 * 4 = 12 is incurred.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: source = \"abcd\", target = \"abce\", original = [\"a\"], changed = [\"e\"], cost = [10000]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: It is impossible to convert source to target because the value at index 3 cannot be changed from 'd' to 'e'.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= source.length == target.length <= 10^5\nsource, target consist of lowercase English letters.\n1 <= cost.length == original.length == changed.length <= 2000\noriginal[i], changed[i] are lowercase English letters.\n1 <= cost[i] <= 10^6\noriginal[i] != changed[i]", "answer": "pass@1", "choices": null, "context": "", "category": "code", "source_dataset": "livecodebench", "difficulty": "medium", "test_cases": "[{\"input\": \"\\\"svqcmtfmmk\\\"\\n\\\"gckeybwxiv\\\"\\n[\\\"r\\\", \\\"t\\\"]\\n[\\\"e\\\", \\\"s\\\"]\\n[595104, 687994]\", \"output\": \"-1\", \"testtype\": \"functional\"}, {\"input\": \"\\\"svqcmtfmmk\\\"\\n\\\"gckeybwxiv\\\"\\n[\\\"g\\\", \\\"e\\\"]\\n[\\\"s\\\", \\\"n\\\"]\\n[639516, 745235]\", \"output\": \"-1\", \"testtype\": \"functional\"}, {\"input\": \"\\\"svqcmtfmmk\\\"\\n\\\"gckeybwxiv\\\"\\n[\\\"l\\\", \\\"m\\\"]\\n[\\\"u\\\", \\\"t\\\"]\\n[537805, 221140]\", \"output\": \"-1\", \"testtype\": \"functional\"}, {\"input\": \"\\\"xwwbq\\\"\\n\\\"jbbha\\\"\\n[\\\"l\\\", \\\"g\\\", \\\"b\\\", \\\"g\\\", \\\"v\\\", \\\"j\\\", \\\"a\\\", \\\"s\\\"", "contest_date": "2023-12-23 00:00:00", "approx_tokens": 572}

The cost of changing the array to [11,11,11,11,11] using 5 special moves is given by |10 - 11| + |12 - 11| + |13 - 11| + |14 - 11| + |15 - 11| = 11.\nIt can be shown that changing all elements to any palindromic number other than 11 cannot be achieved at a lower cost.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [22,33,22,33,22]\nOutput: 22\nExplanation: We can make the array equalindromic by changing all elements to 22 which is a palindromic number. The cost of changing the array to [22,22,22,22,22] using 2 special moves is given by |33 - 22| + |33 - 22| = 22.\nIt can be shown that changing all elements to any palindromic number other than 22 cannot be achieved at a lower cost.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 10^5\n1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9", "answer": "pass@1", "choices": null, "context": "", "category": "code", "source_dataset": "livecodebench", "difficulty": "medium", "test_cases": "[{\"input\": \"[6]\", \"output\": \"0\", \"testtype\": \"functional\"}, {\"input\": \"[48, 82]\", \"output\": \"34\", \"testtype\": \"functional\"}, {\"input\": \"[3, 79, 7]\", \"output\": \"76\", \"testtype\": \"functional\"}, {\"input\": \"[55, 49, 23]\", \"output\": \"37\", \"testtype\": \"functional\"}, {\"input\": \"[1, 80, 99, 46]\", \"output\": \"132\", \"testtype\": \"functional\"}, {\"input\": \"[90, 16, 27, 67]\", \"output\": \"114\", \"testtype\": \"functional\"}, {\"input\": \"[94, 83, 11, 55, 83]\", \"output\": \"117\", \"testtype\": \"functional\"}, {\"input\": \"[12", "contest_date": "2023-12-16 00:00:00", "approx_tokens": 528}

The array sick contains the positions of the children who are infected with an infectious disease. An infected child at position i can spread the disease to either of its immediate neighboring children at positions i - 1 and i + 1 if they exist and are currently not infected. At most one child who was previously not infected can get infected with the disease in one second.\nIt can be shown that after a finite number of seconds, all the children in the queue will get infected with the disease. An infection sequence is the sequential order of positions in which all of the non-infected children get infected with the disease.

{"id": "lcb_00172", "question": "Yarik is a big fan of many kinds of music. But Yarik loves not only listening to music but also writing it. He likes electronic music most of all, so he has created his own system of music notes, which, in his opinion, is best for it.\n\nSince Yarik also likes informatics, in his system notes are denoted by integers of $2^k$, where $k \\ge 1$ — a positive integer. But, as you know, you can't use just notes to write music, so Yarik uses combinations of two notes. The combination of two notes $(a, b)$, where $a = 2^k$ and $b = 2^l$, he denotes by the integer $a^b$.\n\nFor example, if $a = 8 = 2^3$, $b = 4 = 2^2$, then the combination $(a, b)$ is denoted by the integer $a^b = 8^4 = 4096$. Note that different combinations can have the same notation, e.g., the combination $(64, 2)$ is also denoted by the integer $4096 = 64^2$.\n\nYarik has already chosen $n$ notes that he wants to use in his new melody. However, since their integers can be very large, he has written them down as an array $a$ of length $n$, then the note $i$ is $b_i = 2^{a_i}$. The integers in array $a$ can be repeated.\n\nThe melody will consist of several combinations of two notes. Yarik was wondering how many pairs of notes $b_i, b_j$ $(i < j)$ exist such that the combination $(b_i, b_j)$ is equal to the combination $(b_j, b_i)$. In other words, he wants to count the number of pairs $(i, j)$ $(i < j)$ such that $b_i^{b_j} = b_j^{b_i}$.
