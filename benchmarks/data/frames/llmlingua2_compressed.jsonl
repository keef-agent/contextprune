Stage 1 performs input normalization using Unicode NFKC normalization and lowercasing. Stage 2 applies a BERT-based encoder to generate dense vector representations. Stage 3 uses approximate nearest neighbor search via FAISS for retrieval. The pipeline processes 1,000 queries per second on standard hardware. Evaluation was conducted on the BEIR benchmark suite across 18 datasets.\n\n**Document: Technical Report v2.1 — Section 5: Results**\nOur method achieves state-of-the-art performance on 14 of 18 BEIR datasets. Average nDCG@10 of 0.512 vs baseline 0.443 (+15.6%). Key improvements: MS-MARCO (+8.2%), NQ (+12.1%), TREC-COVID (+18.4%). Latency: 45ms average for full pipeline. Memory footprint: 2.1GB for the 110M parameter encoder. Ablation study shows the three-stage design contributes roughly equally to overall performance gains.\n</retrieved_context>\n\nAt the time of their publication, who was the editor of the magazine that published the two short stories that first developed the World Urslula LeGuinn would use for the first of the two books Harold Bloom would later call her masterpieces?"}], "compressed_system": "You are a document question-answering assistant.
