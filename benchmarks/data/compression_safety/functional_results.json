Looking at the chart, we can see that the LAI values tend to decrease as the angle increases from 0.122 to 1.187 radians. This suggests that at higher angles, less light is being intercepted by the leaves, which could be due to the fact that the leaves are more horizontally oriented and therefore less visible to the sensor at higher angles. Additionally, the variation in LAI values across angles could be due to the clumping of leaves in the canopy, which can cause some angles to have more or less leaf area than others.
